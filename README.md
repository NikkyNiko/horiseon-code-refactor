# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description 

This project was created in order to make a marketing webpage more accessible. All non-semantic elements have been changed, with the exception of a single non-semantic element, "<span>". This project has taught me how important it is to make sure to use semantic HTML tags whenever possible, as they can have an impact on both SEO and user accessibility.
